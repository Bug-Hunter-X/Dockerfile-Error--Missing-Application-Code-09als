This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to copy the application code into the image.  The initial `Dockerfile` lacks the necessary `COPY` instruction to include the Python application. The solution demonstrates the correct way to include the application code using a `COPY` instruction, ensuring the application is available to the `CMD` instruction.  This is important to ensure the container executes successfully.
